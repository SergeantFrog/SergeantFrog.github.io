                <h2>RFID Timing Software</h2>
                
                <p>(Project code is not publically uploaded)</p>

                This was my senior design project for the University of Connecticut. We used RFID chips to read the timing of
                racers by reading radio frequencies, which were then uploaded to our database. <br>
                
                My involvement in this project was to read the bytes from the frequencies and manage the database. I then created automated SQL statements to 
                push out information into our created tables. These tables then connected to the created website and 
                were pushed out so that they could be visualized. <br>

                <h2>Frogbot</h2>

                <p><a href="https://github.com/SergeantFrog/FrogBot">Link to project</a></p>

                This is my Javascript implementation of a bot for use through discord. <br>
                
                Currently lacking in diverse functions, but eventual plans to implement hearthstone API to create deck codes with it. <br>
